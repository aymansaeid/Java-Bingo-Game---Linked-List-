# Java-Bingo-Game-Using-Linked-List


-The multi-player BINGO game is a Java program designed to replicate the popular game of chance where players mark off numbers on their cards as they are randomly called.

-In this implementation, we utilize linked list data structures to represent the tombola cards for each player. The game involves two players, each with a card containing 15 numbers arranged in three rows. The implementation includes the generation of random numbers, card creation, checking the status of the cards, and printing the current version of the cards.
